  "transcript": "Uh hello guys. Uh can I get a quick confirmation everybody? Uh I hope everybody's able to hear me. Yeah, just drop a message like yes. Okay, so welcome to this batch. But I hope uh everybody has got got the link from the dashboard how to join the session each and everything. Yes or no everyone? Let's check out like some people are about to join Okay, perfect. Let's wait for another uh 5 to 10 minutes and then we will start. Okay, but let me know how are you feeling for this batch. I hope uh everything is fine from your end. Right. So, we'll just be starting in some time. Thank you. We'll just start in some time. Okay. So, right now it's 9. I'm just waiting for all the people to join. Thank you. Okay. So, sorry guys. Uh, so there was some zoom issue that we have just found out. But, uh, I think now everybody's able to connect, right? Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. But don't worry. Um, I think there was some zoom issues. Uh, but uh, now it is fixed. Uh I've also sent the link in the chat. Uh each and everything looks fine right now. Okay. Just give me a quick yes if everybody is able to see my face at least each and everything right over here. Anybody who's facing problem anyhow we have also done the induction session live in YouTube. So I don't think so you should be facing any problem. Yeah. Okay, just give me a quick yes. Yeah. So, we'll just start in another 2 minutes. I think uh there was some link issues. Yeah. Okay. So, how are you all? Everyone all good. Yeah. Okay. So welcome to this amazing ultimate rag boot camp and uh uh you know uh we in this particular session we are just going to have an index session to make you understand what all things we are going to learn how we are going to learn and how we are going to cover each and every topics. Uh we also have uh Paul with us uh uh we'll be talking about our dashboard. We'll be talking I'll be showing you each and everything in the dashboard itself and uh making sure to make you understand that how uh you will be able to get the mails how when the recordings will be available uh about the badge details each and everything. Okay, make sense everybody? Yeah. Okay. So, perfect. Uh welcome to this new batch again. We also live in YouTube for this induction session. Uh we were facing some zoom issues in the last moment related to some links and all but anyhow I have updated in the group itself. Okay. So uh let me go ahead and share my screen quickly and uh first of all we will start with our you know dashboard access like how does our dashboard looks like each and everything. Okay. Okay. Just give me a quick confirmation if you are able to see the dashboard quickly. Okay. Yeah. If you are able to see my dashboard now in your dashboard, first of all, I'll talk about which course we are talking about. So if you go to krishnah.in. So this is the last boot camp of 2025. So if you go ahead and see that we are talking about this ultimate rag boot camp wherein we are going to build traditional to agentic system with cloud deployment each and everything we will talk about it over here. Okay. And then uh we will be talking about the syllabus each and everything what we have actually what we are going to cover. Okay. So if you just go ahead and click on enroll now. So here you will be able to get all this information and now here you will be able to get the um the entire syllabus. Okay. So this is the ultimate rack boot camp. Here our learning objectives is basically mentioned. If you see step by step all the modules this is going to probably take somewhere around four to 5 months to get completed. What are modules we are going to specifically cover? Foundation of rag lang chain traditional rag implementation working with document parser llama index will be a new module out there uh advanced llama index techniques hstack you know lang graph u along with this enhanced rag techniques and then here you'll be able to see multimodel and structured rag conversational and contextual rag agentic rag fundamentals advanced agentic rag production rack systems cutting edge rack techniques model context protocol MCP end toend projects lot of end to-end projects we will be discussing along with the deployment okay so according to this syllabus here the clear idea is that our focus is more towards agentic AI with specific rags rag is one of the most popular techniques which we are going to specifically use uh as we go ahead head because nowadays every companies have started implementing rag products. Okay. And rag products is really really important for any kind of use case. So there are couple of things that we are going to do with respect to rag. Um one is focus on implementing agentic AI uh uh agentic AI applications. Along with that what we are going to do is that we're going to cover different types of rag. At the end of the day we are going to develop something like a production grade applications. Here the focus is more on coding more on developing production grade applications. Agree everyone. Does it make sense? Yes. I hope it makes sense. Okay. So this is the syllabus that we have. Okay. Now related to prerequisites. Uh so for prerequisites what we have is that you need to have good Python programming language knowledge because without Python programming language it will be not possible to cover this particular batch. Python programming language is must because there we'll be talking about modular coding. We'll be talking about advanced coding in Python. We'll be making sure that we use VS code. We'll be talking about how you can actually use Jupyter notebooks here andself and that we will start from the next session wherein we'll start with the installation of all the softwares that is actually required for this particular batch. Okay. The other thing is that you need to have basic knowledge of generative AI along with that you need to have some cloud knowledge that is more than sufficient to get started. Clear? Clear with respect to the prerequisites. Yeah. Can I get a quick yes if everybody's clear? Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Now the next step uh with respect to the learning that you will be seeing over here is that let's go back and talk about your dashboard because this dashboard is very much important. Okay. So if you go ahead and log into learn.crishnakacademy.com is everybody able to see this specific batch with this four fields? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. We also have a mobile app of Krishnak Academy. So if you go ahead and search for Krishna Academy in Android or in iOS, you'll be able to see these two apps. So if you go to Play Store, here is the app which you will be able to see it. Okay. So you can also go ahead and install the app in your mobile phones. Okay. So, both in iOS, both in this, you have the specific app where you'll be able to see this kind of stuff wherein even though when you're traveling, even though wherever you are going, you should be able to see anything all the recordings along with your entire dashboard access and all. Yeah. You'll also be able to access the recordings. Clear? Now, from your dashboard, do you see all the specific options? Yeah. Do you see this? Yeah. Okay. Forget about this affiliates because I'm the admin. I'm able to see this. But here you should be able to see feed, workshop, courses, and message. Don't worry about this affiliates. this affiliates will will not be visible to you since I am the admin over here. So, it is visible for me. So, first of all, let me talk about this particular dashboard because this is really important with respect to the dashboard itself. Okay. Now, I will just go ahead and write hello all welcome to the welcome to the ultimate rag boot camp. Okay. So this is my message in your group and I will go ahead and select this particular group. I'll save the changes and I'll publish it. Now do you see that you will be able to see this particular message. Just reload the page everyone. So this is the community feed. Let's say that you want to announce something to the group, you want to share your learnings, you can go ahead and just post it over here. So if you go ahead and see on down you'll be able to see that many people make sure to uh upload many things over here is the workshop started okay this is the problem that many people was facing but anyhow we have fixed it okay so here you can see your AI chatbot people keeps on sharing the knowledge over here okay they keep on sharing the knowledge over here and here you will be able to see that uh all the new things that they learn anything that they do they keep on doing this within your community group It is just like a LinkedIn feed. Okay. And this LinkedIn feed, you'll be able to see that uh everything looks clearly whatever you want to post with respect to your group. Any new things, you'll be able to do it. Okay. So, if you just reload this, you should be able to see you can just give a heart sign to this particular message over here. So, if you go ahead and see it over here, welcome to the uh ultimate rack boot camp. So, 23 people have given the engagement. So any engagement over you can reshare you can repost like how we specifically do in LinkedIn that all things are available over here. Clear? Clear everybody? Yeah. I hope everybody's clear. Everybody guys just give me a confirmation if things are clear for you. you are able to understand. Just a second. Okay, perfect. Now okay now once this is done this feeds are basically just to share the knowledge okay then the next section you'll be able to see workshop okay so do you see this entire workshop so this workshops actually gives you the entire sessions that you are having on Saturdays and Sundays I think uh for me I have excess of three three batches so you'll be able to see 9:30 to 12:30 this particular batch Batch access is there. Okay. 2:00 p.m. 6 p.m. another batch is there. 8:00 p.m. 12:00 a.m. another batch is there. And tomorrow probably uh at night 8:00 p.m. 12:00 a.m. another batch is there. Okay. So for you also I think you should be able to see this particular batch. Yes. Yes or no? For November 2nd, right? So 9 to 12 you know you should be able to see the specific batch details. Okay. Got it everybody. Yeah. Yes. Perfect. So at any point of time I think everybody has also received the mail about the class. Yeah. So there should be an email id from supportthe ratecrishnakacademy.com and you should be able to receive the mail and all the links and all out there also. So at any point of time if you really want to know what sessions are there even from your mobile app you can go ahead and check it out over here and uh uh even in the desktop also you should be or in the laptop also you should be able to do it. Okay. The next important session is about the course section. Now in the course section whatever courses you have specifically joined that all courses will be visible over here with respect to the course dashboard. Okay. So if you go ahead and see over here I will go ahead and click for one of the previous batches that we are doing LLM ops. Okay. So if you go ahead and see I'll click on continue. So here as soon as right now let's say this session is going on. This session is also getting recorded. Okay, this session is also getting recorded. Now after now you may be and you may be asking kish when we will be getting the recordings. Okay, so usually after the session gets over like usually the session goes for 3 to 4 hours. Okay, it goes for 3 to 4 hours and in that 3 to 4 hours what we specifically do is that um we cover the entire live session and then we have doubt clearing session after that. So let's say uh right now is 9:20 a.m. IST. Once we cover the class till 12:00 p.m. then we start the doubt clearing. Doubt clearing basically means we ask all the questions. We allow you to uh unmute yourself, talk with respect to any queries that you have. We try to answer them and for that we come first come first first serve basis because we need to cater all the doubts and each and every doubt is important because somebody's asking a specific doubt that same doubt can be for the other person also. So we are making sure that that doubts are answered in a most pro proper way so that everybody's doubts are clarified and don't worry until and until until and unless we don't clear all the doubts we are not going to stop the session. Clear everybody clear? Yeah. As said when the class gets over within 24 hours, you will be able to see the recordings in the dashboard. So in your case, uh if I probably go to the course section, if I click on start learning right now on the induction session, nothing is there. But after this session gets over, we will upload the recording over here within 24 hours. Clear? I know 24 hours is a one day time right but why we are saying 24 hours because zoom also takes some time to process it but we always try to do before 6 hours to upload the video clear yeah clear so this induction session right now is also available in the YouTube it is also live in the YouTube reason that if somebody's not able to join so we are making sure to uh live stream commit. So to talk about like the entire thing. So as soon as this session gets recorded, as soon as the session gets over, we will be uploading the session over here in the dashboard. Clear? Yeah. Perfect. Now after this you have this messages section. Okay. After this you have this messaging section. In the messages section, do you see this very important message group? So, this is the community chat like you want to talk with your peer-to-peer. This is where like a WhatsApp group. Okay? Don't make a separate WhatsApp group. There is a group over here. You'll be able to see for your ultimate rag boot camp. Everybody should be able to communicate with each other. So, let's say if I say hi team over here. So, this message I think everybody should be able to get. Don't write the message right now. I'm just testing it to talk about it. Right? So for every batches in uh Krishnak Academy, we have separate separate chat rooms. So that any discussions that you really want to talk about, you should be able to talk about. Okay. Huh. One very important thing is that whenever the sessions are uploaded, okay, in the resources section, you should see all the materials that is uploaded. Okay. So let's say this was one of the session that I was taking. Okay. Now for all the handwritten notes, all the materials, everything will be uploaded in this resources section which you can download. Okay. There is also a Q&A section which you can go ahead and communicate it over here. Okay. Any kind of chat that you really want to do that will also available over here. Clear everybody? Can I get a quick yes? Yeah, it's a good dashboard because I'm not showing you unnecessary courses and all what you have enrolled for that only you should see in the dashboard. That is the reason why I like this particular thing. See over here you should be able to see feed what communication is going on. You should be able to see your courses only, right? And here you should see only your messages within the group. If you are joined in multiple batches, you should be able to see join multiple batches. Do you see anywhere that I'm showing you any other courses over here? Just check it out. Is this a dashboard good or bad? No, not a simp single course is visible over here to you. Right. So all these things is there. Okay. Now once this is done now we need to probably go ahead and talk about how we are going to take the session like this. It will be a live session over here and we are going to probably teach each and everything with handwritten notes each and everything that will be visible in front of you. We don't prepare ppities. I don't like preparing. We write each and everything. So our notes will look something like this. See our notes will look something like this. So we'll write each and everything in front of you. We will draw each and every diagrams in front of you. So that your learning should be very much good. Clear? Clear everybody clear? Yes. Okay. Now let me introduce you to one more mentor uh within your u within our circle right now. So Paul, do you want to show your face? Oh, you're muted. >> Yes. Yes. Yes. >> I think I'm audible everyone. >> Yeah. >> Yes. Guys, please do give response in the chat. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Hello everyone. So, my name is Sarang Paul. So, I've been working with rag and agentic based systems and I think few people might know me from the previous batches that I have taken. So in this batch I'll be taking a lot of classes I can say majorly with respect to rag. What are the recent research that is going on in 2025 with respect to rag. Okay. So all those important things we'll be talking about. So I hope that it will be a very interesting journey for the next 4 months. A lot of new things that you will be learning research with respect to even production. How to finally make a product. We will try to make things much more easier. I will try to make things much more simpler for you so that at the end of the day in your organizations you can implement such systems. Yes, we'll be covering rock metrics guys. Don't worry, I'll be looking into the chats. A lot of chats are coming. Okay, I'll be taking the questions personally. So yes, don't worry about that. >> Okay. Now, one more thing guys u many people have also asked me related to prerequisites. Yes. Yeah. Prerequisites. Yes. Yes or no? So for prerequisites what we specifically do for people who have uh specifically for our students right whenever uh now see you know that parallelly we also make sure that we upload uh Udemy courses. Okay. Now in Udemy courses you'll be able to see can you see my screen can you give me a quick confirmation like what are the basic prerequisites? Many people want may want Python. Many people may want different different things. So over here you'll be able to see most of our courses that we have right. Let's say this generative AI course with lang chain and hugging face. Okay. So here this will be the course for the prerequisite and specifically for your batch. Whenever I get a free coupons I make sure to share courses to you all. Right? So this time I will be sharing this entire course. So everybody can go ahead and use this coupon. I have given the link in the chat. Okay, just go ahead uh use those and that is for first come first sub basis. Okay, you can use this course for your prerequisites. I've given the uh link in the chat not in the YouTube chat only for our students who have joined. Okay, happy everyone. Yes, again it is first come first serve basis. Uh yeah, are you partner with corporate companies? Yes, I think this this course is also available in um more than 200 plus companies. Okay. So this is the thing that I can do it from my side for you all and don't worry as we go ahead you know I will be providing you more courses okay more courses whenever we got one we we get one okay so uh the main aim is that any prerequisites that you you require we provide it through this and uh you know uh it is always a good practice that we do like every month we distribute a lot of coupons to our students who have joined the live batches so that you don't need to probably take the Udemy um out there. Okay. So, just use the link. Yes, Hersh Naven, it is available for you. Just use this particular coupon that I've given in the chat. Okay. I know. Sorry for the YouTube folks, guys. Uh it is for our students first. If it is remaining, we'll also send it to you. Okay. Clear everyone. Is everybody able to access the course? Yeah. And please don't forget to put your ratings. Um say all our batches are really amazing like this one also we have crossed 111k you know 111k throughout 180 plus countries. This is just a recorded here we have covered python we have covered all the prerequisites for NLP u you know generative AI each and everything what is the prerequisites that is required you can probably go ahead and access it. This is just from our side to you all and whenever we get more free coupons, we should be able to share it to you. Okay. No, you don't need to pay. Yeah, Amit is okay. If you have bought it, no worries. I'll share more coupons as I get. Okay. Okay, perfect. See, just use the free coupons guys. It's okay. And again, I'm telling you, whatever new batches I come up with, I give lot of free coupons to our students. Okay. So, this is the just see the coupon code out there and you should be able to use it. Clear? Let's go to the next step now. Yeah, let's go to the next step. Okay, Paul, uh, anything that you want to cover related to dashboard? Anything uh, anything pending? I think I've covered almost everything. >> Yes, I think the dashboard part is there. Prerequisite also we have covered. Then I think we can go a deep dive into syllabus little bit step by step. >> Please, please share your screen and go through the syllabus once again. >> All right. All right, everyone. So, I think you guys can see my screen. Please provide a confirmation in the chat. Yes. All right. All right, guys. So uh as we know that uh this particular batch will be focusing on rag. Okay. So with respect to rag when I'm speaking okay so we will take a journey a long time like when the first concept of rag came okay so initially like uh we will start with the traditional uh rag implementation like the foundations of rag. So we will be talking with respect to implementations as well as research. Okay. So for example the first paper of rag that came around. Okay. So like we'll be talking about research papers in this course. What are the different things? Okay. So I'll be talking what are the main highlighted points in every paper. So we'll be taking a journey. As you can see this is 2021. So from 2021 to uh till now I can say what are the major papers that are coming around rag we'll be talking. Okay. So like a long journey of 4 years what are the major papers like more than 20 to 25 major papers that we'll be talking about. Okay. So I hope the audio is fine guys. Please let me know because somebody is telling that the audio is breaking. So please let me know. All good. All right. Fine. Okay. So we will start with the basic rag implementation. What is rag? The core components. Okay. Setting up the rag. I'll try to do a pythonic implementation because uh the idea is that you guys should be familiar with Python. Okay. as we will be doing a lot of modular coding here. Okay. So, uh the idea is you have to be good in Python. So, if you're not good in Python, please try to like uh see the lectures which are provided. Okay? And just try to cope up because at the end of the day the implementations slowly slowly I will start with Jupyter notebooks then from Jupyter notebooks to ids that will move where completely it will be like object- oriented programming. Okay. All right. Now coming to the major frameworks for rag. So like uh langen one of the major I can say dominating frameworks in the uh AI ecosystem right now. Okay. So if you go to the GitHub you will be seeing a lot of stars like Langchen. Everybody knows about LCan I think. Yes or no? From somewhere. Yes. Because uh simply if you look into the major one so Langan GitHub. Okay. So everybody is using langent one of the major ones and if you look into the stars of this particular project. Okay. So simply uh always follow the project stars. So based on that you know that the community has accepted it. So more than 120k. So yes we'll be going a deep dive uh with respect to rag implementations in langen. Okay. So here what are the new things and even the latest things that are coming from langen in the experimental module. We'll be talking about those things step by step. Okay. Now uh initially we'll start with the basic uh text processing. Okay. So like different type of character splitters are there. Okay. Then comes embeddings very very important. How to make good embeddings? We'll be talking about these things in detail. What are the different type of embedding providers like OpenAI embeddings is there, Gemini is there, Olama your local okay uh then uh hugging face embeddings are there like in hugging face I'll be telling you what are the top models right now embedding models that you have according to the benchmark it's always about the benchmark that we'll be talking about okay so for example if I show you the MTB leaderboard so from here you know that what are the best models right now so in this particular course we'll be using those best models. Okay. So some things can be paid guys. Okay. But uh like right now if you look into a new model came the llama embed neotronone. Okay. Now like this is right now the best and which is 8 billion. Now 8 billion models we cannot run it in our local system. So probably we can go with Gemini which is API based from Google and based on this particular I can say details okay according to the latest research that we have we'll be doing all those implementation the idea is to use state-ofthe-art okay so we will be always selecting the top 10 right now okay according to the standard right now which is being followed in November 2025 for this course yes we'll be using APIs for sure open AAI Gemini okay Uh so I can say few guys at least uh most of the things will be free but sometimes at least having a $5 credit helps you because few things in the course because uh like after 2 months or 3 months when we will deep dive into some advanced stuff. Okay. So there it's not about a huge amount you need probably the charges because I think within $5 the entire thing that can be done in this course. Okay. and very specifically most of the stuff we will try to use Gemini as it is completely free but yes I hope you guys uh get the idea everyone what I'm trying to say we will be using the latest research and what is the best right now in 2025 okay all right so embeddings I told then comes vector store very very important like uh so many vector stores are there okay so we'll be talking about at least five to six in detail in this course so I think super linked vector databases are there. Okay. So majorly in the market which is being used uh we'll be talking about okay so a very long list right now that I am showing you. Okay. So out of this at least I can say five to 10 different we'll be using open source as well as two paid ones like quadrant very specifically VVE that we'll be using and open source is there like fires is there. Now how to optimize vector databases okay how to do batch uploads those things also we'll be talking about in this course because when you try to build a production based rack system okay how to upload your data okay so in different types of batches how to handle GBs of data so those things also we'll be talking about so this was all about the vector DB part now coming to the next part okay the traditional so this part like the using pure Python turn building uh with lang chain these things evaluation and testing as few people ask yes we'll be talking about rag evaluation metrics as well as frameworks okay it's not about only I will be telling about the metrics what are the major one famous right now in the market like we'll be talking with respect to raas okay very very important okay so this particular framework like it's being adopted widely as you can see the number of stars here. So it's widely being used. So in this course we'll be using RAS a lot. Okay. So with respect to evaluating then once we have started then the most important part is uh the most important part that I feel is document passes. So here uh right now as you can see doc lens. Okay. So this is a minor mistake. It will be doc link. Okay. So let me just show you docklink GitHub. Okay. So this is open source completely. Okay. And even we'll be talking about few proprietary uh projects. So like using this uh how to parse data as you can see like this is GitHub training. Okay. The number one repository of the day. So widely being used I can say. Uh then this is completely open source. Then we'll be talking about little bit llama pars. Okay. Because llama pars there are limits. This is a paid one. Then we have unstructured again unstructured has a opensource version and then the paid one then comes vectorized. So four different type of major document parcels. Now I cannot say that uh out of this four this is the best. It totally depends upon your data. Okay but I will tell you yes always test with these four. Okay. And out of this you will see that at least one is working very good which will give you good passing at least with a rate of more than 85%. Okay. So the most important part how to get data from different type of data sources. So this that's why we have kept a separate module and I think this module will go for two weeks at least because this is the first step of building a good rack. All right. Right. So once we have covered then we will come to few other major frameworks uh in uh right now the community has accepted like llama index. So this is another very very famous project. What are the major fundamentals here? Just like langen. First we will start with langen. Then comes llama index. How to handle the different type of documents here? Different type of sources indexing query. Okay. how to perform uh uh two different types of searches that goes around. Okay. So like vector search okay and then comes your like BM25 search. So those things we'll be talking about like to build a good rack system you need to have hybrid search systems. Okay. So those things we'll be going then query optimization comes with respect to llama index that we'll be talking about. Okay. So few advanced topics this is very very uh like with respect to llama that we'll be talking okay so custom configurations now these are some advanced part so once we'll be covering the basics I think this will be probably in the second month okay so again advanced retrieval so like in retrievers we'll be talking about this particular topic is very very important how to make a good retriever okay so different types of retriever okay so right now like in the past 3 years we have seen a lot of research with respect to the retrieval based systems. So we'll be talking about that and most of them are available in lanchen and llama index. Then uh once we have covered uh llama then we'll move to haststack. Okay. So hstack again widely used in production. Okay. So hstack AI. Okay. So here you can you can see here the production ready opensource AI framework. Okay. So another one I feel you can see the stars right here 23.2K and very specifically I kept this module because till now in other courses we have never discussed hastack. So this is the first course I can say that okay where we'll be using haststack. Okay. So this will be something new. Okay. And I know like many people have worked with lang chain and others but I feel that this part will be new for okay like a lot of things which are already implemented in haststack. So building pipelines your production pipelines is very very easy using hstack. Okay. So that's why we'll be talking about this uh particular uh I can say project in detail. Now once we go back. Okay. So haststack fundamentals how to build a rag using haststack. Then comes advanced techniques. Now these techniques are very very important working with ID. Okay. Then comes query decomposition. Okay. So if a big query comes you can break it into multiple queries. Okay. Then comes the reasoning. How to build react agents that also we'll be discussing later when agents will come into the picture. Query expansion. Okay. how to enrich your metadata. Okay, so these things in detail. So you can think about like everything like uh if I'm talking about metadata ID these topics are like everything like 30 30 minutes topic. So like what are the new things that have been coming all of this uh new implementations with a full pipeline that we'll be talking about now specialized applications very specifically with respect to multimodal. So that's why vision plus text pipelines is mean that from your document if you have some type of image. So image plus text we will try to extract both things and then we will try to build. Okay. So that's why this part once we have covered then we will start our agent techic journey because till now it this uh like hstack lama index lanch all these frameworks majorly it's rag based implementations but once we start our module 8 module 8 is all about your agentic based systems so the best framework right now in the market which is dominating which is langrap in other batches also we have taught langra okay so similarly here also So we will start with langraph because there are so many frameworks in the market but I feel that yes lang graph is one of the most powerful one for agent orchestration. Okay. So here we will start with the fundamentals how to do the setup what are the core things the core component like graph is there tools are there nodes are there all those things that we'll be talking about then comes building a chatbot okay what are the different types of architectures like react agent okay uh then we will move ahead with uh like production features very specific to langrap okay so like langrap streaming a stream events orchestration worker. So now these are advanced topics of langra. So we will start with the basics. The idea is to move ahead like a bottom to top approach. We will start with something easy stuff and then we will jump into application because the advanced topic will be a part of application. It's not like I'll be just teaching you the concept. Okay? There will be always an application guys. At the end of the day, the idea is that in this entire course, we'll be building more than like 20 to 25 applications easily. So once we have covered lang then we'll move to some advanced rack techniques very very important. So this is very specific to uh like production. If you are really building a system the first initially like till modulates it's all about basic stuff. Okay, it means that okay, you know the core concept but what about if you want to apply it in production this is where things comes you have to do more work it means that I'll be telling you these things but you really need to do your hands on I'll be sharing everything but uh this is the part where you do your research according to your own data for your organization okay so here like advanced chunking and pre-processing okay like uh parent chunking child chunking all those things that will come into the texture. Then comes your hybrid search combining uh different type of searching like vector search with texture. Okay. Like BM25 is one of the major famous algorithms which has been widely accepted in LLMs or very specifically with respect to transformer architecture. Okay. So BM25. So that's why we'll be talking about that. Then comes query enhancement with ID. So like this will be pure implementations based on a framework and probably like the framework will be with respect to langen or llama. Then the next part module 10. So this is where vision comes into the picture. Okay. With structured data the idea is that to uh fetch the data from some type of like structured uh sources like it can be uh postgrace. Okay. or like how to fetch the data from some type of unstructured like we will be taking the example with then multimodal now this is the part where things will become interesting because at the end of the day it's not always about text you have to work with images are very very important like videos if I'm talking about okay so like if you are working with videos you have to break the videos into frames now from those frames you have to extract what is the information. Okay. So in this way we will try to make things for multimodal rack. Now this part will be something new according to the 2025 standards because the multimodal rag implementations majorly we have seen major research coming from 2024. So this part will be like very very in other courses also we have not gone uh like in depth in this one but here we'll be talking about the major embeddings like clip okay the clip embeddings that comes into the picture then uh working with PDF different type of data sources this will be pretty much common you can see here audio and video will come into the picture working with ST okay TTS like speech to text okay then text to speech those things will Um now here conversational and contextual track. So anybody who is building a production system for them module 11 is very very important. Okay. So like user profiling okay like how to give memory like for agentic frameworks like uh you will be using I'll be talking about few major uh memory base like uh memo. Okay. So like AI agents forget but memo remembers. This is just a memory layer. So that we'll be talking about in this particular course and this will be integrating with our rack based systems that we'll be building. I hope everybody is understanding the flow like step by step what are the things initially it will be all the basics till modulate but once after modulate things will be much more I can say towards like the idea is to make it close to production because exactly we cannot show this is production but the idea is make you at least close like yes these are the things which are actually used in production. Yes, everyone please let me know you are getting the flow that we have taken in this particular course. Okay. Now, uh we'll be talking little bit with respect to prompt engineering and uh context engineering also because right now in 2025 context engineering is a very hot topic. So for that like cont how to build contextual rag how to get better context at the end of the day getting better context uh is a very very important thing when you are building so those things that you'll be focusing on then comes agentic rag okay so like uh here a lot of new things that will come into the picture because at the end of the day uh rag is there but we will be using agentic frameworks on top like langraph that that's why we have covered it before because using langraph we'll be building agentic rag like uh lot of rag s rag will be there adaptic rag will be there hybrid rag will be there different types of rag because total number of rag counts if you ask me by the end of this course you can simply say that I know more than 20 types of rag okay more than 20 guys really different types of rag architecture that we'll be talking about es gardeners we'll be talking about don't worry very specifically uh like uh we'll be using one of the major opensource project for guard rules. Okay. So like uh guard AI. Okay. So this one let me just show you the so this is a famous project you can add guard rules. Okay. So this project that we'll be implementing. Okay. So in our version so if anybody is asking with respect to guard yes now the next one. So once we have completed okay then comes advanced agent integrat systems. Okay. like autonomous agents, multi-agent systems. Here like the idea is to build five or six different type of agents. Then we'll be using some type of orchestration tool. Okay. How they will be communing among each other. That's why the communication protocols comes into the picture. How they will be collaborating. Okay. Then uh like how to finally productionize your uh entire orchestration of the agents using langraph. Now this is the part where like things will be little bit more interesting because this is purely for production like how to scale up. Now this is where little bit of networking comes into the picture. See guys now this part is little bit less about AI much more about like deops with respect to networking cloud networking simply like catching strategies. Okay so here we'll be working with radius very very specifically for catching in this course we'll be working with radius. I think everybody knows about radius. If you don't know, you'll be learning in this course. Okay. Then comes load balancing. So with respect to load balancing, it can be a vertical load balancing or horizontal load balancing. Okay. So little bit concept about I can say system design. So yes, we'll be talking about these concepts very very important if you're building any type of AI system. Okay. Or simple like uh software. Okay. SDLC they also follow these rules. Okay. So for so load balancing then comes asynchronous processing very very important then comes your docker that's why container deployment we'll be working with docker a lot in this course like the idea is that uh being an AI engineer or a data scientist okay so you should know till uh I can say the container part okay so tiller the other part can be taken care by the MLOps guys very specifically or the AI ops okay or the LLM ops but you should know how to work with containers because at the end of the day very very important so docker we'll be talking about and even I think and at this time I'm planning to include portman okay because in other courses majorly we have discussed docker a lot but this time in this one even we'll be talking with respect to bman all right then comes deployment and monitoring okay so here comes your cicd pipelines we'll be majorly working with uh github actions And now the main thing with respect to cloud, which cloud in the chat I saw many people like which cloud, which cloud, which cloud, we will be using AWS. Okay, AWS I think everybody just keep in mind we won't be working with other clouds like GCP probably like few things but majorly this course will be around AWS. All right, I hope I have made my point clear. So later on don't ask why not Azure simply like Azure yes it is widely used in production I know but in this course we'll be working because like in Azure I feel that few of the services that I have and it's better for business when you are learning something you can easily switch cloud if you know one service here there are similar services in other cloud so just be at good in one cloud so that's why I always suggest my students from other batches everywhere just be good in one cloud if you're good in AWS yes easily you can switch to Azure it's not a big deal it's not completely different rocket science okay so you can adopt because uh every organization I cannot say that everyone is using Azure or everyone is using AWS or everybody is using GCP probably some are using a totally different like digital ocean or probably they are using like lenode previously right now it's digital ocean okay or pottal cloud so many Oracle cloud so different so right now with respect cloud we'll be using very specifically AWS in this course. Okay. No, we won't be using uh data bricks. All right. Now coming to uh cutting edge rack techniques. So these are the different types of rag like self rag, adaptive rag, retrieval, craft rag. Okay. So finetuning. So now this part is something like where you need to spend probably like uh to get a good GPU instance you need a good GPU as I hope everybody knows about if you're working with LLMs you need good GPUs whereas in rack it is not required so that's why many people are adopting because at the end of the day when you are having a project the infrastructure cost is the most important thing okay so any project two things like time and revenue. So simply like GPUs are faster but at the end of the day it comes with the cost. So little bit we'll be talking with respect to finetuning also very very important because somebody might have some type of domain specific data and uh right now with respect to even we'll be talking about a particular concept of raft. I don't know how many of you know this is pretty much uh famous starting from 2024. Anybody has heard about raft where you mix rack plus fine-tuning? Okay. So if you have know so we'll be talking about so this is one of the major research papers from UC Berkeley. So we'll be using uh I can say academic institutions majorly few uh major papers that come from UC Berkeley Stanford we'll be talking about those papers okay and their implementations which are available okay so how this is different so that's why I told like uh this is rack plus fine-tuning guys okay not rack plus agent don't get confused so uh then few other research organizations then very specific ically if I talk about like IBM what are the uh major research that is going in IBM because IBM is really good with respect to rag okay now rag based papers that always comes around like blended rag metagen blended rag okay different types of toolkits that comes around okay so really guys see in this course we'll be talking about a lot of things now you have to understand entire research paper I cannot discuss okay I'll be telling you in this research paper these are the important things but now it's your job because if I start only discussing research papers it will take more than 9 months to complete this course or probably one year because everything in a research paper okay so like if you try to go in depth with respect to the mathematics behind it then really like it really takes a lot of time to decode but if you think it from uh like uh production point of view we have to need to understand the applications okay how to get this thing and how this is better than something. Okay. So for example, if I talk about this paper now, this is blender track. You can see four August 2024 after this came metagen the upgraded version of blender track. So you have to understand what is the difference between the meta gen and the blender track. In this way always I will try to make things simpler for you. Okay. Now why this paper is better than this paper? I hope I make my point and everybody get it because at the end of the see after this course completes like after 5 months okay then I cannot take classes so you have to be updated with the research. So I'll be telling you okay now from this place I get the information okay something new came in so that my research team can at least do some type of implementation and show me a P. So similarly if you are leaders simply in your you are in architect level okay or uh so simply you can know that okay now I have to look into the recent research that is going on based on the research I can tell my team and they can actually present me with a P. The idea is always look into what is the state-ofthe-art research. So that's why in this like a lot of research papers guys okay so more than like 20 to 25 papers that I'll be discussing I'll be telling you like that entire journey. Okay, starting from 2021 till 2025. That's why I told a long four years. Okay. So once we have done now let's get back here. Okay. So we'll be talking about MCP. I think many of you have heard about MCP model context protocol. How to build MCP servers. We'll be talking about that with respect to our rag. Okay. So like rag with MCP like first we'll be building a rag then that particular rag we will be exposing it through an MCP MCP is a protocol if you don't know we'll be talking about this in detail because the common standard of exposing your uh I can say application your rag application it will be like API best everybody should be familiar with fast API in this course we'll be using a lot of fast API okay then exposing our application through MCP then exposing your application even through G RPC okay so few standards according to production those things yes we'll be talking about then comes finally your project section so this will probably start from the fourth month I can say okay so the different types of projects that we have how to build a basic QA now uh don't think about all the projects will come at the end it's not like that uh that everything will start so probably like basic rack system this will be I think in your month one only the idea is that I don't want to be uh I don't want to make you directly that on the fourth month you will learn the deployment the idea is that every month you learn little bit of deployment and then every month we try to increase that level okay how to make it better how to make it better the idea is to improve it yes guys I hope you get it so like project one and project two. Then comes project three. This will be probably in the second month or the third month. Okay. Then multimodal rag like project four and five. This will be very specifically to your like fourth month, end and fifth month. Okay. So I hope everybody get that what we are trying to deliver here. It's not only just teaching RA. The idea is that adopting rag and implementing rag in your own production systems in your own organizations. Yes. Yes. Swagat. So you are telling please teach us from scratch. Yes guys see that's why initially the module one to module 8 you have to understand this is the basics. Okay. So module one to module 8. After module 8 things will be advanced. I hope I have made my point clear. Do we build rag agents? Yes, we'll be building. I told you we'll be building agents. That's why you have Langra. In this course, we'll be using Langra, the major framework. Subas is asking, can you share the research articles? Yeah, I can share today. But really, today's course is not about teaching. Today the idea is to interact and give you guys the overview exactly what are the things that we are going to do in the next four to five months. Okay. So during classes I will be sharing the research paper link. Don't worry about that. Okay. Yes. Little bit about prompt engineering. Yes it is required. And with respect to context engineering yes cag will be covering. Don't worry I told you more than 20 types of rack. So yes cag will come. CG comes before raft much more advanced one okay so don't worry okay so catch a based systems yes we'll be talking about CAG don't worry okay yes graph rag will also be covered don't worry we'll be using neoforj very specifically for that fine-tuning uh we won't be going a depth with respect to finetuning but I'll be telling you yes these are the major frameworks and if you have a domain specific data you can use a llm22 Because really guys if I am showing you finetuning the cost of showing you fine tuning is very high just probably like with the amount of data that we'll be having. Okay. So probably I need to spend more than $1,000 just to bring the complete infrastructure because with one GPU I cannot do a finetuning. I need a system probably with 16 GPUs. Okay. Uh very new to all this terminologies. Okay. Don't worry. We'll be taking things slow guys. That's why module one to module 8 basic stuff. Okay. Then comes your advanced stuff. So don't worry about that. Okay. So it will be a complete journey at any point of time like whenever I am taking the classes or Chris sir. Okay. We always go with basics. Now somebody's asking about Lora Q Lura. No, this course is not about LLMs. This course is about rag. Okay, so that's why those concepts won't be coming. Okay, I'll be showing you uh like with respect to finetuning because in finetuning very specifically Qura and Laura is widely being used with respect to LLM. So there I'll be but it's not about in detail that we'll be talking about the idea is stick to rack what infrastructure required I'll be talking about you need good uh like uh GPU instances very specifically with respect to finetuning in other places you don't need majorly uh with respect to ids okay now in this particular course like probably in the next course uh next lecture next week Saturday we'll be talking about all the installations but uh the major ids will be like VS code guys at the end of the day I might use because in my system I have more than 10 different ids but yes we'll be using uh VS code majorly I use cursor I do use wind sub I use ko in my system I have more than 10 different ids so don't worry it doesn't matter at the end of the day VS code does the job okay so this is ultimate for beginner yes I will say that uh we will start with the basic effects because right now in 2025 if you are really looking for a job you have to be good with respect to rag because majorly all the organizations are implementing rag in their systems okay because everybody has huge amount of data the idea is to get the information or basically to build a retrievable system so that's why rag very very important in every type of domain if you think about finance law everywhere very specific LLMs are built like LLM for finance those are coming into the picture LLM for like medicine for pharma okay so yes we'll be talking about that today no class today it's all about the introduction the idea is to discuss the journey okay for the next four to 5 months and then I think uh what's the time so we'll be start taking the questions one by one okay so I think Is uh any other thing that needs to be discussed because I feel that the curriculum part and other things I have covered. I use PyCharm. Yes, PyCharm is fine. No issues. >> I think uh we are we are good uh I think uh we're good with all the syllabus. Okay. Um so guys uh let me talk about one thing very important you know. So here why we are focusing more on this particular batch and uh you know soon we are also coming up with a product uh and I just want to show you that particular product. Please let me know if you are able to see my screen quickly. Okay. So uh if you see over here this is the product that we are developing. Okay. uh the product uh still has not been announced because next uh after a couple of weeks this will be available. Okay. And uh this entire product is a like one of the important component is rag over here. So what is the use case that we are trying to solve over here is that you can see that in in this world right right now how many opensource libraries are available? How many so open source libraries are available? Do you have a count? Do you have account tons and tons right and what is the problem right now with chat GPT if you go and ask any code related to lang chain lang graph or related to related to open source libraries it basically provides deprecated code do you agree everyone yes or no yeah so it it usually provides deprecated code because all the chart GPT models has uh some specific cutff training date right so this is one of the problem that we are trying to solve. If you really want upto-date code at any point of time uh for any kind of open source libraries and if you feel going through the documentation is always a pain uh we just try to develop that particular product and soon we are going to launch this. Let me just show you the working over here. Right now we have included so many different frameworks. Our plan is to cover more than 3,000 plus frameworks. Okay. uh here you can see lang chain lang graph each and everything is available over here right so two things uh I think context 7 does the same context 7 only gives you the context like uh let's say that if I'm searching for anything over here like crewai okay and if I just go ahead and select this and I'll write agents using creoai so what context 7 does is that it provides a context only okay But here the context is the most important thing in order to get the response over here. Okay. So what we are basically doing is that you can also go ahead and use any of our chat feature over here. You can put your own LM models any kind of LLM models. And let's say that if I go ahead and use Creoai, I want to probably go ahead and start agents with Creo AI. So here we have also created the entire chatbot. Okay. And this chatbot is in such a way that you can go ahead and integrate with any kind of LLM models whatever LLM models you specifically want and based on that you should be able to get this. The best important part is that we have also we are also come up coming up with an MCP server for this which you can integrate in your VS code which is already developed. So once uh the announcement is already made u we will be showing all that particular use cases. Now I am specifically focusing on this because I really want my product team because we will be hiring product team and for them rag is one of the fundamental use case that they should really know about or skill sets that they should know about. So there will be scenarios that we definitely want to hire some people from this particular batch whom we are teaching rag and who are basically there uh you know with respect to understanding all the concepts with respect to rag because we really need to improve this particular technique. My entire team me Paul my okay everybody has worked in this particular product and from past couple of months two to three months we are making sure to make this particular product much more better okay so that is the reason why I'm showing you this particular product because there may be like if you all do do the assignments do the projects in time uh whatever things that we are giving we would definitely consider your profile also because we are planning to expand our team specifically our development and productive. Okay. So, uh good idea altogether. Yes or no? No, it will be uh coming up with a subscription. It will be less than chat GP but at least okay and we are also coming up with the MCP server which you can integrate in GitHub copilot anywhere that you can. Okay. Okay. My is also over here. So, uh >> hi sir. Hi everyone. I hope I'm audible. Great. Hi everyone. I hope my voice is going lot better now. Hi sir. Good morning Paul and sir. >> Yeah. Great. Yeah. So sorry I just joined a little late. I was working on something last night. So yeah everyone I hope you're excited about the batch right. I was seeing the labels being covered and honestly many many things are there which will be very very good. And as sir said for regarding the xenodox as well we are using many of these things and we want that students do get pretty uh expert in the same thing so that we can hire first from our pool of students the people who we are basically training and of course we're learning these things firsthand from us because I guess no one is teaching AI and all these concepts in this much depth right so that's the whole idea I think sir I think we have shared the coupon uh do we need to share share one one more >> yeah please share please share >> cool so great everyone uh yeah so I think sir must have already walked you through and as a overall benefit like we do share and we want all of you to learn and get a quick head start so I'm sharing course uh coupon for another of the course right so let me just quickly uh give you that right and before I do that let me quickly walk you through like I think sir must have already asked but uh please make short that all the coupons which we are a I hope you're all able to see my screen right so this is the kind of UI which all of you will see once you so this will be the course name once you are getting enrolled can I get a quick yes if this will be the case great so yeah uh once you do that everyone two things you have to do first please make sure that you complete the course go through everything right Udemy provides a very good overall UI and we have made sure that it is very very affordable and easily available for everyone. Second, uh please make sure that you leave the rating. So there is a leave a rating uh button or basically in the UI. So when you click leave a rating easily you can provide us five star with your lovely thoughts that will help us to get uh basically more students and get all the teaching which we are creating right discovered by more of the people right. So with that uh we are providing a overall I'm providing and pasting it in the chat which is a coupon code for course for Microsoft autogen. So Microsoft autogen for those who are not aware it's an awesome framework from Microsoft. So please make sure that you join the same and yeah do provide your lovely feedback to that. So more than again 51 stars 51k stars. Okay. So please make sure I'm sharing the coupon code. I will do one more thing so that all of you can get easy access. Just give me a minute. And uh meanwhile I hope all of you are able to use that. So that will be very very helpful. Let me just create a new uh folder and drag and I will provide you coupon. So just a minute because I think you cannot paste the like you cannot copy the coupon from there, right? So just one second. Great. Yeah. So great everyone just uh I've shared a link just go to that link and from that you can easily copy the coupon and apply that. So do make sure that you provide a lovely rating right for that I think sir has already shared multiple coupons with you. So that's a very good head start and lots of learning. So please make sure that you take full advantage of this and yeah if you have any doubts anything we will always of course be there. I think we will be having a very very great like in-depth doubt session now as well. So yeah when you will open with this link the coupon will already be applied. You don't have to pay anything. Okay. So that's the whole benefit. Uh sir can you please send me the coupons? I will also add it in the link only the one which I have shared. So great everyone uh just a quick humble request please make sure that you cover the same and you provide the ratings right that will be a lot helpful. So the latest one which I have given they you are you can easily just copy the same and please make sure that you do like use it as you can see the coupon course will be coupon code will be in the end okay so do apply the same it's a easy learn AI as the code you will be seeing the price for free okay great yeah I think that was all uh from my end >> okay perfect I I think Paul we can start the doubt clearing now. I think we have covered almost everything. Uh from next uh uh Saturday session guys we will start the installation uh software installation and then we will also go ahead and start with the rag. Okay. Uh yeah Paul uh you can start unmuting you can become the host and uh start or do you want to give a break and then probably start it's up to you. >> Yeah I think we can start from 10:30. Okay. >> Yeah. Okay. So let's take a 10 minutes break guys and then probably start the doubt clearing. Now doubt clearing will be like first come first sub basis. Uh we will be allowing one person to talk at a time and uh don't worry we will try to cover everybody's doubt. Unless and until we don't cover everybody's doubt we will not stop the session. Okay. Okay. And sessions are on Saturdays and Sundays from 9:00 a.m. Okay. uh till I think 1:00 p.m. or 2 p.m. it can go based on the doubt. Thank you. Okay, Paul, let's go. >> Okay, let me start the timer. So, so we'll start from Enter. Yeah, everyone welcome back. Okay. So now I will start taking questions. So whoever is there they can raise their hand. Okay. I think everybody can see a raise hand option in your zoom window. Okay. So simply you can click on raise your hand and I'll be taking your questions one by one. Now one important thing so right now we have like more than 180 students here as I can see okay so simply like if 100 people raise like I will be taking the questions one by one okay so it will take time so don't think that I won't be taking your question okay so let me start with so right now I think uh suchin is there okay so I will start with suchin then first suchin you then Rajat then Mohammad Michael Shahad I will come to you guys one by one okay so Sachin I think we can start with you >> yeah hi Paul um yeah thanks for this uh actually I was just talking about one small thing I was also going through your rack boot camp uh the the ODMI course I just want to understand how it is different from this course uh the one which I am just enrolled with is it more advanced or what difference in between. >> All right. Uh so like yes for sure as this is a live course things will be much more advanced and here we'll be talking much more from the research and the production perspective. >> Okay. Okay. >> In the Udemy course you Chris sir has covered all the important concepts. Now the idea is to use those concepts and build a full scale application. >> Okay. Okay. Got it. Got it all. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. All right s. Next. Rajat. Hi Paul. Uh hope I'm >> Yes, you are. >> Yeah. So my question is uh related to first is the system requirement. Uh so is there any specific system requirement that we need to have when we'll be going to the advanced concepts? >> I think see right now in 2025 if you have a 16 GB RAM okay Core i5 or an Ryzen 7 it works. So nothing need a GPU. >> Yeah. M1 will work now. M1 Max. >> Yeah. Yeah. Even see I will be teaching you on M1 Pro. >> Okay. >> Okay. >> I have M M1 Pro 16 GB. So I'll be teaching on that one thing. >> Okay. And other question is uh related to uh technical experience. So I am overall 10 years of experience into front end uh UI. So uh uh great knowledge in JavaScript and all the oops concept. So I have been doing uh Python from past 1 month. So I have a strong grip on Python not using any specific libraries. Uh so I think hope that that is sufficient. Yes. See if you are having 10 years so similar things the idea in this course we'll be building APIs you are good with UI. Okay. So for example if you're working with react nextjs okay so any type of those frameworks very specifically once we build the API you know you have to do the integration >> with respect to the UI okay so like for other student because in other courses also we have seen people building like crazy UI now the other students think how he has built it so simply like I know that you can do it but others because right now we'll be focusing majorly on APIs here back end part >> yeah yeah so means my question was means I am not a pro in u uh Python but from past month I'm learning Python and doing my hands on and everything not specifically used any uh libraries related to Python only the basic programming and functions and all if you're good in JavaScript I know you are good in JavaScript so it's not a big deal you have to be just good in any one programming language then you can because Python is much easier if I try to compare it with JavaScript or Java or Go anymore okay so it won't be a problem. >> Okay. Yeah, that's it. Thank you very much. >> All right, Rajat. Next, there is Mohamad, Michael, Shahed. Okay. So, yes, three people. So, one by one, you can go ahead. >> So, let me start. This is Michael. >> Yeah, Michael. Go ahead. >> So, the question is um I'm interested in the offline LLM. So I've created a small rag which is uses doesn't use internet at all. So do you cover anything similar to that >> underlying underlying question underlying question is I mean I I I'm in a in a different country and uh here they do not allow a at all absolutely not it should not reach the internet. So I have to create an offline rag which works strictly offline. So do you cover such something like that? Yes, we'll be covering very specifically right now. For example, with respect to offline, I'll be taking an example with respect to in this course. Okay, the right now not custom LLMs, the available LLMs uh through Olama the models. Okay, so that part we'll be talking about how to create embeddings, local embeddings, nothing like without the intern. Yes, we'll be talking about that my >> awesome. And one other last question is uh I'm I'm sending lot of questions and I don't see anybody reading my question. Is am I chatting on the right window? >> No, you are chatting. See right now if more than 100 people write in the chat one shot we are only three people. Okay. So right now we are looking into. So yes I might message if you have any question you can let me know right now. That's why it's a onetoone discussion. >> Perfect. Thank you very much. >> Hello sir. >> Yes. Am I audible? >> Yes, Mohamad, you are. >> Thank you sir for the opportunity. Sir my question is what are the possible career paths uh we can acquire with this course and course and knowledge gained from this course there are see now if you asking very specifically like jai engineer AI engineer or the term can be only data scientist also okay so many things that comes don't just be very specific to a profile the core part is the things that you are teaching it is completely applicable to the geni and very specifically like the AI word. So anything like for data science and other stuff that also comes into the picture because very specifically if I say the term data scientist like a data scientist can do anything because at the end of the day like you'll be working with data. Okay. So like majorly all the major profiles will be open to you but for data science there are few other things like you have to know machine learning, deep learning those stuff also come into the picture. But this is much more highly uh I will say much more towards aligning towards geni part. >> Okay. >> Generative AI. I hope you get my point. >> Sir, one more question sir. >> Yes sir. >> With from only this course can be uh land on any job. >> From this course we will give you the fundamentals. Okay. With respect to applications part and the research part. Now you have to start applying. simply okay but you don't think about see like the AI space there are a lot of things when you apply in an organization now what is the requirement >> now that is the main thing you have to see your skill set whether it's matching to this I can say that from this particular course if somebody is applying for a geni engineer I can say that more than 40% of the skill set that we'll be covering but there are other things also in the geni space like only working with LLMs okay now that's why I'm taking then also working with ops like the LM ops part that is that 20%. Okay. So it's not about I cannot say we are covering the 100% skill set but the major things we'll be covering right now in 2025 what are the major things that are going okay the students uh that they are learning for applying a job there are many people who are looking for a switch everybody this will be very very helpful. >> Thank you sir. Thank you. >> All right Mohammmed. Hi Paul, this is Shah. >> Yeah sure. >> Uh just want to check so there are two courses mentioned in Udemy for this course. One is uh building AI agents agentic AI system via Microsoft and then complete generative AI course. So these are the two right that's all. >> Yes. And these coupons and they make uh it at cost 500 rupees or make make it at make it free of cost. So right now in this particular uh like see in Udemy what you get basically monthly like we can provide you a certain number of coupons for free. So generally for our paid students who have enrolled to our live batches we provide them for free. That's the idea. Now what happens just think about okay now we share the coupon now some students share it here and there. Okay. Now once they start sometimes the coupons might get expired like few people are telling it's not working for me the link because there is >> I'm also writing it down that can be because I know M and Chris are just created the coupon. Okay. So just now probably if somebody is sharing outside this okay in some other groups I know it will be exhausted like every month we do share it's not about that we are sharing only right now today in the induction session okay like next month also if we are coming with any new courses in Udemy then also we do share with our students >> but I I think I tried within seconds but it didn't work >> which one is not working So it didn't work for both the courses. Uh >> both the courses just be sure the coupon code at the end of the day because I think uh that matters. >> I tried it from the bugs that link also and I tried directly also and uh another case it worked >> from my chat history. Just wait let me go one is this one. I checked with one of my friend also who is there in this course. Uh for him also it didn't work. So we both tried immediately but just wait because with respect to the chat I'm just sharing uh like uh last time Chris shared. Okay. Why I can't paste it in the chat? Um M are you there? Huh? Okay. Because I don't know why I cannot paste it because the one with uh uh one just wait I cannot type it in the chat. I don't know why but uh the coupon uh which was provided by Chris sir. Okay. So the uh the last part was like free coupon. Ah right free coupons >> and the one with M it was learn that's why >> right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right so both of them didn't work for me >> okay just try to check in incognito mode okay >> okay >> just try to have because like if it's working for others it should work for >> no I checked with one of my colleague also who there in this course for him also he didn't >> because see nothing like it comes from Udemy Can you please share it with the students? I >> Okay. Which location are you from? >> I am from Delhi and he is from Guro. >> Okay. Um Paul, allow him to share the screen. No, it's possible. >> Okay. Yes, that. >> Okay. Just a second. Just a second. Okay. Just again, once again, click the link. What is the coupon getting applied? Just let me know >> in the URL. Just check once at the end. Just click the link and just let me know like what is the coupon URL? What is the coupon code that is getting applied? So that is not the coupon code right Amit did you try? Okay Prashant for you also that is not the coupon code ACC that's not >> guys come on I've given the coupon code now you want to publicly announce that coupon code so that you'll not get it then the people will all >> you want me to share my screen or what >> no no just tell me what coupon code is basically getting applied >> free coupons and learn AI >> so free coupons is not working out there >> no No, it it still says u 500 something the price >> what 500 something means >> that cost cost of the course it doesn't get applied it means it should see some other coupon code is basically getting applied I'm saying No, it's not getting applied. >> Once you that just check whether you already have that course or not first of all you don't have that course. >> No, I don't have that course. >> Are you sure? >> Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. >> Let me add you to panel. Okay. Then the coupon code will be exposed actually. >> That's the main thing. What you can do uh add to cart. If it's showing 500 >> add to cart, go to checkout and then you apply the coupon code. >> Uhhuh. Then manually you apply the code. >> Okay. >> Try that. >> And this is for everyone. Go see that there are two things. Either that course may be in your dashboard already. You may have >> Okay. When I went to add to cart, then it made it free. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. So add to the cart and then it'll make it free. Okay. >> Guys, this is for everyone. Okay. And I know this problem usually happens. Udemy does not allow that many free coupon codes but anyhow um we are just trying our level best to do something. >> Thank you. >> Yeah. >> All right. Sh. >> Now let's move to Okay. Karthik is there. Then comes Arl Krishnanu. Yes. Karthik you can go ahead. >> Yeah. Hello. Am I audible? Yeah. So my question is about uh this interview level things. Uh so for uh only about Janai if you are applying so currently there are a lot of things they are asking. I have attended like two to three interviews. So they are coming coming up with TensorFlow Pyarch everything. >> Yeah. Because the fundamentals are data science the journey starts from like Python stats machine learning and okay deep learning okay that's why NLP computer vision then the geni journey started like starting from 2020 to end okay so that's why like if somebody is applying okay the idea is that you should know the fundamentals >> okay so but but is that really needed or uh is Is it okay to have a overall overall picture on those things or because I don't have opportunity I did not get opportunity to work on TensorFlow or anything. If you will create a projects also it will be like a portfolio projects. It is not a product level uh product level uh projects also. So that is the reason I'm just asking that you guys going to help us in in the mock interviews and all uh in this type of situation >> uh with respect to interviews very specifically the things that are part of this course because I cannot bring pytor tensorflow MXNet those things right here that will be totally overwhelming for others it's a very specific requirement of an organization okay so that's why like probably they might have a product okay on top of tensorflow pyarch that is running on top of that that they want to add some type of agents. Okay. Now very specifically if I'm working with computer vision that's what I do for example if I build some type of image classification or a segmentation or an object detection. So what I will do I will be wrapping that particular module okay to an agent and then so that's why knowing that core fundamental actually helps you and how many years of experience you have >> IT industry I have already 9 years of experience. uh then 9 years of experience the expectation will be there nothing we can do like 9 years like anyone above 6 years or 7 years the idea is that you should be comfortable with the fundamentals of data science because that is pure like uh the core fundamentals that people have been applying from 2016 that's why >> yeah so one more question so I I'm just creating a bot chatbot that will replace the analytics team in my company uh uh that will text to SQL level with a with a llama 2. Is this a good idea to go ahead? I'm just um getting a uh getting an idea about that because uh in in my company they're not allowing us to do this but I'm just want to show them. >> Yes, approach is good but there are few frameworks like vana.ai and others that you can use very specifically for task like SQL to text and those type of task. I don't know exactly what is your text stack but uh like yes you can work with llama 3 I know llama 3 is good okay or probably uh like with if you want to go with open source like Maverick is there and others yes those are good I can say >> yeah okay but for the interview level this is a good one right because I can showcase that this is >> yes probably majorly most of the organizations are working with SQL based databases like posgress and others so yes for Sure. >> Thank you so much. Thank you. >> All right. Go Artik. Next. >> Hi B. >> Yeah. >> Uh so my question is regarding uh the project. Uh do are we also covering any medical chatbot kind of project here? >> Medical chatbot I don't have that is not very domain specific. The idea is to make it generic. Now see in our use case we can take some medical data. Okay, that's the thing. The idea is not to keep things domain specific rather than to make it generic. You bring your own data, you plug and play. I hope you get my point. >> But we would learn that kind of skill set that is required to create that kind of uh >> yes, I'll be telling you that yes, now this is how you build a rack. Now any guy probably from law, finance, others like like telecommunication, they can bring their own data. So the idea is not to be domain specific. Okay, we will try to keep things generic with respect to data. >> Right. Right. And one more thing like uh I do hear the term N8 and automation framework. So uh by any chance that is required to learn uh in this course as well. >> Are you a developer? >> Uh not a developer. I'm at architect level in the organization. >> All right. So like previously you have some type of development experience or you are handling a team. what kind of profile my >> okay like data engineering profile N8 is uh pretty much the no code stuff okay because at a certain point of time I think that there are certain limitations with respect to no code when you are actually building a full scale product okay your entire product cannot be built with respect to no codebased solution okay for customizations and other stuff you need so anything is really good if I talk with from the no code uh point of view okay so really you can build quickly agency and other stuff. He has lot of customizations but really like if you are building a full-fledged product then you have to come to some other frameworks that's why anything is good for beginners if you're building a prototype I will say thumbs up okay but really if you're making it into production okay so then I will suggest that okay probably that might not be a good choice for a long term >> might be creating the MVP right uh >> yes for prototyping MVP it's really really good with the client presentations uh quick release in that case we can go for the end >> automation >> project on boarding you can showcase that yes really we can do this later on like but behind the scenes uh like even that pure race DLC things comes into the picture >> mhm but in creating the real time production grade system it is not really required right I mean there >> yes I will say that it's not now see if it is a very very small feature very very small okay then probably you might use because I feel that it can be part of your main system but it cannot be the main system. I hope you get my point. >> I understand. >> Yeah. Thank you sir. >> All right. Next. Krishanu. >> Hello sir. Uh >> uh I don't have any questions but I I'm here to just tell you thank you so much sir. uh you to myself to Chris the way you make the courses affordable is pretty amazing and I here to just uh say you thank you to all and is Christ here presenting in the >> yeah yeah I'm here I'm here please >> thank you sir thank you so much and you don't know you how much you helped me in my career uh I bought all your Udemy courses and just although I just completed the four courses at basic to advanc mathematic Python with DSA and data analysis boot camp and data science boot camp. Uh my question is uh do I need to uh go through any more thing to understand this course much better? >> Yeah, today I've given you some free courses. No, you take that also. Okay. >> I I I I also I bought that also in previous. Thank you sir. Thank you so much. >> No worries. Then see in the future anything that we are coming up we usually share all the in our live batches. Okay. For free. >> Thank you. just here to talk to you and uh thank you uh sir and in I am very excited to um just live in this live program excited to watch you do in future. Thank you sir. >> Thank you. All right, let's move to our next participant. There is Aijit B. Then uh Sanjay Shagur, then comes Kirish. Three people I have unmuted. >> Yeah. Hi Paul, can you hear me? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. Hi, good morning Paul and Kish. Yeah. First of all, thank you so much. Um I have been an Ardin follower though. So uh my my primary question is that uh you know um as you were taking us through the syllabus you we are we definitely learned that we are going to do a lot of things through AWS and then there will be certain models say OpenAI will be involved. So I just wanted to understand how much of the other extra things that we have to buy in say in terms of services with respect to AWS usage or even open AI. Uh just wanted to get an idea. >> OpenAI uh probably like uh we will try uh to stick to Gemini. Okay, it's free with a certain limit. In some cases, we might go with OpenAI or probably a $5 refill is more than enough for this entire course. Okay. Uh now probably see if I'm taking a document of 1,000 pages for example. Okay. Now if you use openi embeddings the $5 credit will be exhaust totally exhausted. Okay. So you have to be smart. You don't do it. I can execute it from my end. You have to take that decision. Okay. So really it is not important. You can crop that PDF into 10 pages and then you can do it. a simple example I am giving because it totally depends upon the data sources. Okay, try to always stick to smaller ones for your learning. You get the idea I'll be taking a bigger amount of data but you don't do it. So I feel that a $5 is more than enough. >> Okay. >> Okay. So you have to be little bit smart because yes I will be telling you okay don't do this don't do this. So please follow that in the class. >> Sure. So primary to execute the concept is the primary idea. It's not the the quantifying of the content. And with respect to the AWS services, I have not used AWS. I have only worked on GCP and a bit. So >> okay. So like that is fine like here also like uh with respect to instances very specifically if I'm working with GPU instances it will be much costly but majorly we'll be using EC2. Okay. So EC2 probably with a 2 GB RAM or 4 GB RAM. So probably like your monthly bill won't cross 100 rupees that I can say probably 4 months 400 rupees that you can take it. Okay. Like every month we won't be working with deployments. Probably the last 3 months we'll be working. So 100 rupees 100 rupees you can keep it that also I'm telling it in the higher point of view. It can be 200 also in total. So don't worry about that. But uh like if I uh like uh majorly all the services are there. The idea is that you start the service and then you close it instantly. Once the app is working you do the testing then you close all the services. That's the major thing. If you forget somehow for example if you are working with app runner uh not app runner I think uh uh few for example like uh you have worked with GCP in GCP you have uh that uh cloud uh GCP runcloud or which service is there like directly it works okay now if you keep on running it it becomes costly so always close the services like I'll be destroying all the major services that I'll be launching in a certain class and I'll be telling you please okay so Don't start and then forget because after 7 days you will come and then say Paul I got a bill of 3,000 rupees. It already happened with few students in other batches. So just be active. If you are proactive in class their own meaning problem. >> Thank you so much Paul for that idea. Thank you. >> All right let's move to our next. So I think anyone Kesh or Sanjay you guys can go ahead. >> Uh hello Paul. >> Yes. Yeah. So just one question is there uh whether we'll be building the conversation a chatboard because sometimes now in interview they have asked me regarding this. So >> we will be building chat bots but again the idea is building geni chat bots. We won't be using because you can build chat bots in more than I can say 100 ways >> but we'll be sticking to the geni part very specifically. Okay, because there are other very specific frameworks like everybody has that like Amazon there is lex from Google there is dialogflow okay so that's why I hope you get my point the idea is sticking to ji based access like ji based chatbot okay and that chatbot will be for >> okay but building for some specific domain something like that suppose I have >> for specific domain the data will only change you know again the idea is I'll be teaching you generic you can bring your own domain specific data Yeah. >> Okay. Okay. Second thing whether we will be working on the Google pull up because it will require the Gmail uh sorry that Google drive uh sorry but uh right now >> so we see like I'll be working with Jupyter notebooks. Now the question comes you can execute it in Google collab okay >> or in your local system. I'll be using majorly local system. I'll switch to Google collab if I need a GPU. >> Okay. >> Okay. because that's the only thing otherwise if something runs in my local then why I will switch to I will provide you the IP yv okay so simply like if your local system is not so much good okay you can upload that notebook to collab and you can do the execution I hope you get my point >> thanks for this just for that is actually I have my office system right now mean office laptop so here the Google drive not work it is disabled so that's why >> right so don't worry it will be majorly local things okay so right now majorly in a course where I use a lot of GPUs then only I switch to color that's why so don't worry it will be much more local based implementations >> okay thank thank you Paul for >> hey Paul uh Gish uh so my question is will there be any use case based where we will be working with the relational database >> relational database I don't I think because the data source really doesn't matter to me can be any data source but >> because the the project which I will be working uh very soon in my org we have a large relational database uh on top of which we want to build a rag >> okay because very specifically working with like SQL based I don't think there in the project we have such >> but like in a class I can discuss about how to work with that probably by taking an example with VA and others that I can showcase you. Okay. >> Yeah. Okay. Thank you. >> All right. So, next uh we have people who have already please do lower your hands. Okay. So, there is Sai Rahul, Chandan Kumar, Mishra, Nagesh. Three people. Yeah. Chandan I think you have uh >> yes >> you can go ahead anyone say or chan >> yeah am I audible Paul >> yeah chandan >> yeah yeah yeah so first of all the most important part of the question is uh I will ask later but um first of all I would like to give a big thanks to you and kish and may uh for giving back to the society I mean this is really I would like to appreciate and I know that what kind of efforts are going in and in designing the course and making a affordable. So you guys are really doing a great job. Uh so big kudos to you. And coming to the question part, uh uh do I need to have a cloud subscription to try out things here at my end? >> Yes, an AWS account. >> Okay. So you would suggest that subscription there. Okay. And uh what level? >> It's not a subscription. See the idea is you create a new account. you keep your card attached or through EPI at least something like if something paid comes up because in some cases there will be certain services that will be paid everything doesn't comes under a free tri okay you have to understand so that's the only thing that's why I told you a monthly you can take that entire estimation it will be less than like 200 300 >> yeah so the free free tier I can take right I mean that will be sufficient at least to try out these >> yes major we doing the things in free tier but in some cases. So probably just think about I I have an application which cannot run in a 2GB system. Probably in that case I need to switch from a free tri to a paid tire instance. Okay. It totally depends upon the application. We will try to stick but in some case. >> Yeah. Okay. and and and I think you have covered it but I just want to go a little deep into that what level of Gen AI knowledge is expected as a prerequisite here like is it at the theoretical level or even at some level of understanding of the underlying details as well >> we will start from scratch from the rack perspective so the main like see two things rams this course is focused much more from the rack perspective so we will start from scratch I told you I'll be taking a journey starting from 2021. So things should will be from scratch and what are the things right now in 2025. So you really don't need to go somewhere or look into I will cover majorly all the major concepts. >> Okay. Yeah. That's thanks for this Paul and and uh one last question u is that uh will you be more focusing on the opensource or the enterprise solutions uh to >> I will always start with the open source then I will move to the proprietary ones. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks Paul and Christian M if you're listening. Yeah. But yeah, >> thanks a lot guys. >> Thank you sir. I'm here only sir and back. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. >> Next. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. So my question is more on the prerequisites part that is there. Right. So again I'm coming more from a management background with basic understanding of Python like we work with some of the developers and so on and so forth but like I have an understanding I could do some of minimal coding and all but I just wanted to understand is there something do you have a list of links or list of courses that we could do or we could practice that I know this is long long process like like we have almost like four months of course is there something that we could practice myself along with these so that I could improve and understand it better as and when the course processes Yeah already Chris sir and m already I think they have shared so in every Udemy course there is a prerequisite part with respect to python if you are comfortable with python there won't be any problem because see I told you like till modulate things will be easier so like the initial two months if you are coping up with the things if you are comfortable with the basic python then slowly slowly because I'll be not teaching you object- oriented programming completely but I'll be showing you the application So if you're familiar at least you know the concept you understand okay this is how it is working then you can easily cope. Got it. Got it. Yeah I think uh those courses I'll definitely go through and I'll continue to practice. Thank you. >> All right. Next uh let me unmute. V is there. A Raj Mudas sir then comes Abhijit Pushi. >> Yes, three people. Yes, anyone can go ahead. >> Good morning. >> Yeah, good stuff so far. I I am really looking forward to it. Uh um and and the content wise things looks very promising. uh I was just looking for more structure around uh uh the assignments and projects. So basically uh I have got a good idea of what all we are going to be covering in the course right I think we have a module wise breakup what I was looking forward to is considering four to five months of periods of duration that we have right on the Saturday Sundays we are going to meet if you could structure those modules according to those sessions that would be really great and more productively around the kind of assignments and projects we are targeting uh for each of those sessions so uh you know I have a foresight that you know by um month one I would be getting ready with these sort of things and I have something more u uh uh concrete and tangible at my hand presentable manner you know it gives me better to plan things if you could if you guys can you know put that thing that would be really really a huge benefit >> all right now uh see uh really like uh I cannot plan exactly like in the next month or in the 10th class exactly what will go on but uh like a rough estimation if I say like uh uh like we know like in this week we'll be covering that so exactly on Saturday and Sunday like what is going on that I cannot say but I know in this week probably because some topic might take two weeks >> even a weekly target even a weekly outcome right >> weekly target I can plan a very specific uh sheet then I will create and probably by next week I can share okay >> you want to hold hold anyone accountable here to their neck It is just that >> it will be a rough estimation that I'll be doing and based on that okay assignments are something like after every class I'll be telling you the things that I have applied the idea is that you always replicate it with a different data source okay you can use the core concept uh because generally initially it will be a lot of Jupyter notebooks the idea is that if you can replicate it into an object- oriented programming application okay attach fast API with them that will be my thing if you're not comfortable fine because after one month again I'm going to talk about those things. >> No that that's that's a fair point. That's a fair point. It's it's mostly around the kind of projects I can create because I think so my primary intention of joining this course is that how much hands-on can I do with every session. Knowledge wise I think I picked a bit and pieces from everywhere. I did some courses also. So knowledge wise I think I'm there but from a practical uh project wise you know I think I'm not there yet. Especially from a productionized u project perspective I'm still lacking that understanding although I'm working as a senior engineering manager I am not that hands-on today but I definitely work with the team so that I can govern things better from that perspective I was looking at and yeah >> yes >> and from >> I will be talking from that perspective a lot actually from decision making that's why like I will be talking about research rarely anybody talks about research if you know >> okay so like the idea is that you do your research. You can tell your team okay now this is the research try to at least build a simple P okay to test it out with the others simply >> right right I I want to lead the talk you know that's the thing I want to lead by showing casing by showcasing by example right okay this is what is there and then I expect others to follow on and and replicate that uh behavior because I would be unfair for me to expect others to do something which I was not able to do things in the first place right >> yes like uh even I do it. See just think about there are so many new things that comes around everything I cannot do but I always like look into the research probably I list out the things for my team okay so that they can actually implement the things and then I can actually take a better decision >> y >> okay so yeah it happens like with everyone because everything I cannot do by myself that's >> absolutely so just to summarize my points one is if you could have some kind of a breakup tentatively I'm not I'm looking at a ballpark but just from a perspective that will help secondly the research papers was right. If you could put it somewhere that would be really >> I will always put the archive links of those papers like class wise in every class whenever I show you a paper I'll be talking okay but like initially in the same exit I can create another page and I can list out all the papers that we'll be doing it in the course >> right we can make it more collaborative maybe just you know spitballing here maybe if you could add some kind of a place within your site right where we have the feed workshop courses messages a section over there that basically is like a library of papers for people. I don't think it is possible from that side back end side really like I can put it in the sheet wise and then the lecture wise in the resources section you'll be getting like the class PDF okay then the research paper link that way we can do it that way from the back end really it is not possible >> no worries I just thought of sharing things yeah >> yeah thanks thanks for good stuff thanks >> all right mud sir next >> hey Paul Aijit here >> yeah a vijit >> uh Paul First of all, I would like to thank you Chris and Mayang for creating such amazing courses which is basically a short and crisp content and which is actually highlighting the important aspects of the current AI industry with agentics and all what is going on and I'm personally very much excited to meet Chris because from the day one I think from 200 four I have been following him uh not four I think basically for last two years I've been following him for his courses and learning AI and I'm very excited to see him live on the call. So Chris, thanks for creating such amazing content and the philosophy you have is to keep learning AI which is a very good thing for everyone. Your message is very good and uh I really like the course and basically the amount for which you are giving such a huge learning it is really amazing. And second thing Paul which I wanted to say is like in terms of the course right I just wanted to understand is like uh I am a engineering uh lead and I'm my background is mainly in the development and I'm currently working on this AI and all in my office the my my interest towards this course was more in the rag because your course is mostly on the rag and it is designing the rag world which I more interested to learn. So what I wanted to know is like my skills in Python is very basic. So what I wanted to know is like if I want to meet the pace of the course what all the things I should be focusing more on the Python so that I can learn this and whenever you guys are having the sessions uh my learning with the Python and whatever you teach it meets so that I can go and learn those uh concepts in Python so that I can uh whenever you teach the session I can match it up. So I just wanted to understand like what are the areas I should focus more on the Python thing. >> If you if your fundamentals of Python are pretty much clear okay then it's more than fine because here uh syntactically if I'm talking about it will be much more about the new frameworks that we'll be talking in this course. >> Okay. >> Okay. And the objectoriented programming is very very important because that also comes under Python fundamentals only. Okay. like uh I will be using functions for sure but later on like probably when I'm building a full scale application at that particular point of time it will be just like a complete Python package okay so object- oriented programming is required in that particular prospect >> if you are not familiar you can actually look into that particular oops but other than that if you are just comfortable with Python it won't be such a big deal because eas my background is basically into Java with object oriented programming so it will not be >> then yes not a single issue if you are from a Java background really because you know object oriented programming much better as compared to Python guys I >> yeah so I've been in 15 years in Java only so I just wanted to understand like nothing to worry >> okay then I'll focus more on that >> and one last thing is like uh if uh in the course which uh in the course right when uh we have this the web the preac academy is there a possibility that uh uh you also put the these things like the links which we were talking right in the previous question the somewhere uh documented or maybe in the chat when you do right >> yes yes yes that will be part like whatever the things that I'll be discussing probably in a certain class or as a resource it will be always available in your dashboard >> okay >> so don't worry about that because I know because see probably what happens uh uh like when I take doubts that happens mutually like 10 people or 10 people will ask 10 different questions. Now all those 10 so doubt part I don't keep it in the part because that is very specific to a certain student. >> Okay. Probably I might have shown 10 different links but that is not related to the class. >> So the context is totally different. So that part we never keep it in the dashboard. I'll be directly sharing it to in the class. Okay. But the core part that will be discussed in the class with that context whatever the things that I'm sharing it will be part of your dashboard under the resources section. >> Okay sure thanks that is what I wanted to know. Thanks Chris. Thanks Paul. Thank >> you sir. >> Next var is there. Hey VJ. >> Uh am I? >> Yes. >> Yes. So yeah my basic doubt was uh I'm I'm coming from DevOps background and uh the currently the project in which I'm working uh we are using all these technologies like rag agent AI and uh mainly developers are working on that part. Uh so my basic question is uh I'm excited to learn these uh text tag but uh when I look for a job opportunities after this how I can integrate my previous DevOps experience with this tech tag. >> All right Barach >> okay now it's something like this question has been asked very specifically from the DevOps background. Okay. Now for two types of roles S sur and DevOps that I'll be talking about now in the market starting from 2024 there is a very specific uh like uh I can say one uh thing that has been looking like the integration of EI with DevOps. Okay. And how many years of experience you have? >> I have 7 years of experience. >> Okay. All right. So generally like anyone more than six or seven years of experience. Okay. So people are looking for a AI platform engine. Okay. Now this is a new buzz what like AI plus the mixture of DevOps entirely with SR. Okay. Where you'll be handling the entire infra. Okay. So you have to look for that part. So for that what you need to learn very specifically the AI services which are uh available in a certain cloud. So probably with respect to AWS or with respect to Azure. >> Okay. Okay. And then the integration of those services to build your complete like whatever the platform that you were building. >> Okay. So that's why the term platform AI engineer I know few people who have done the switch very specifically. Okay. From S sur role to that AI platform engineer. So very specifically I told you about this because entirely like you'll be working with Kubernetes and all those things that you have done in S. Okay. Now with that the integration of EI services as simple as that. >> Okay. So in that role you'll be responsible for building the solutions as well right? >> Yes like you'll be working with the engineers because majorly what happens like I can say that every data scientist or everybody is not working in the ops team that ops like MLOps probably like if you're working now if you're learning AI and others you can be handling that. So like probably the team has done the containerization. Now it's your job to pull that particular image and from there move it to certain staging then probably to production those things that will be controlled. >> Okay. And uh for that specific role uh will the data science fund foundations fundamentals also be needed like uh machine learning? >> You should know the basics. The idea is not to go into a deep dive because really what matters to you is the container running successfully or not. >> So that is part of the other team like whoever is working because alone you can't do everything. You have to understand you have to always think from a perspective of teams. Okay. So yes if you know the concept it's good then you know exactly how the application is working the entire flow of the application. Okay. Like from the starting point of the app, how it is doing, how it is exiting. So those things you will know if you don't know few concepts really it doesn't matter because at the end of the day you know that okay you will sit with the engineer you will ask okay now how the things are exposed here you can simply look into the docker script you will get an overall idea okay but if you want to go deep dive you can simply interact with the team >> and if you know the concepts it becomes much easier >> okay sure Paul thanks that helped very all Right. Next there is Ajay Singh Amit Jan. Okay. Uh then there is Critica. Okay. Sonali. >> Can I speak Amit? >> Yeah. Please go ahead. >> Okay. uh so uh I have around 16 16 to 17 years of workex u and right now I lead the agentic AI product management for uh in Accenture. Uh so the thing is that I'm not into coding anymore. Uh although I have an engineering counterpart who's leading the team. Uh I've been a developer in the beginning of my career. I mean I started as an engineer then moved into data science roles then did my MBA but post my MBA I've been in product roles um but I mean I've been reading uh about these uh GNI LLM rag context engineering everything so conceptually uh I learn love to learn because I'm I love to learn maths and all the mathematics behind what is happening u in these algorithms Uh so I just wanted to understand from your perspective also because the problems which I see now in production when we are building uh products is that when you start to use these libraries GitHubs just as a boilerplate right uh because when you start applying these uh codes u whatever you get from internet or githubs there are a lot of algorithms which are getting rolled out every say new GitHubs coming up they don't work because your data is different right uh so the crux lies in understanding the fundamentals uh behind these small things like context engineering mostly in rag it is about being able to chunk your data properly have the right retrieval strategy and then curating the prompt in such a way or the context in such a way that it fetches the right answer right so that is where I feel that fundamentally engineering team at least in my case I've seen that engineering team try to do things very fast and then they it doesn't work the way as a product manager I want or my client want uh so from your perspective how would how should I take learning or how should I maximize my learning in this course considering the fact that I'll not be coding anymore in my career right I mean I'll not get I I might do a project two. I've done project two. I built my small small language models on weekends. I've done those drag engine also. I've built uh on on weekend like a pet project, right? Uh but now the expectations from me at an organization level are very different. U so yeah, just wanted to pick your brains on that. >> Okay. Now uh from your perspective if I'm talking about like if you're handling an engineering thing then also like this can be but if you're completely into business really like >> completely into business I have to get into those discussions where I'm designing I >> okay if you are designing and architecting any type of engineering system with respect to AI if I talk about then things will be helpful because I'll be talking about a lot of amount of research like for any leaders aritect paper every week one at least one >> if you are into that okay then you will because the idea is that you can take better decisions >> yes >> for me that will be the main thing >> yes >> I will tell you yeah so that's why I told you know like starting from 2021 till 2025 >> all the major papers with respect to rag so at least I told how many types of rag uh that I'll be talking about more than 20 types of rag Now you can think about from this like any team if I'm talking about they can build a rag within 7 days but it is not always possible okay you can build the bare minimum I can say if you really want to build a rack system with all the research that you have okay probably it might take 3 months"
